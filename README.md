# About the name

Every month at work, I had to report to the head of my department how much time
was spent working on each project. This information would be collected from each employee and compiled into
"Internal Use Software" information. 

I figured it would be better for all parties if I could track the data accurately instead of estimating, and I happened to be looking
for a personal project to take on. 

Thus, the `ius-time` CLI application was born.

*TLDR: IUS = Internal Use Software*
